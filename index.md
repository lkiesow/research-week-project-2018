Research Week: The Idea
=======================

Working in IT, you see a lot of interesting topics which you like to take a closer look at.
New projects and technologies are developed every day.
Old technologies have evolved over time.

As a student I always liked to play with these technologies.
Now, with my full time job it's actually not that easy anymore.
I'll try to keep myself updated but unfortunately
I cannot just spend a day ignoring my job,
playing with some new and fancy project.
The problem of time…

That's why I decided to take a week off and dedicate this time to just that:
Trying new stuff, looking on how things have evolved over the last years
and finally, reporting my findings on this project blog.

Let's get started.

Android Development: Updating From 2.3
======================================

*Research topic for October 29, 2018*

The last time I developed a smartphone app was [back in 2014](https://github.com/lkiesow/andCA)
with a project developed for Android version 2.3
…some old folks might still remember that ;-)

A lot has happened since then in mobile app development and I like to catch up.
Hence, my first target for this day is to get an overview over recent
development techniques.

My second target is a bit more specific. That is to fix a bug in
[Simple-Calendar](https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-Calendar) and
[FreeOTP+](https://github.com/helloworld1/FreeOTPPlus) each.
Let's see how far my newfound knowledge can get me.
