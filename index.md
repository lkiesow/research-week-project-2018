Research Week: The Idea
=======================

Working in IT, you see a lot of interesting topics which you like to take a closer look at.
New projects and technologies are developed every day.
Old technologies have evolved over time.

As a student I always liked to play with these technologies.
Now, with my full time job it's actually not that easy anymore.
I'll try to keep myself updated but unfortunately
I cannot just spend a day ignoring my job,
playing with some new and fancy project.
The problem of timeâ€¦

That's why I decided to take a week off and dedicate this time to just that:
Trying new stuff, looking on how things have evolved over the last years
and finally, reporting my findings on this project blog.

Let's get started.

Android Development: Updating From 2.3
======================================

*Research topic for October 29, 2018*

The last time I developed a smartphone app was [back in 2014](https://github.com/lkiesow/andCA)
with a project developed for Android version 2.3
â€¦some old folks might still remember that ;-)

A lot has happened since then in mobile app development and I like to catch up.
Hence, my first target for this day is to get an overview over recent
development techniques.

My second target is a bit more specific. That is to fix a bug in
[Simple-Calendar](https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-Calendar) and
[FreeOTP+](https://github.com/helloworld1/FreeOTPPlus) each.
Let's see how far my newfound knowledge can get me.


Reporting Back
--------------

The first day is over and all-in-all, I declare it a success.
It could certainly have gotten smoother,
especially considering a stupid and completely unnecessary fight with udev,
but I wrote a demo App for my Android phone
and fixed an annoying bug in Simple Calendar.


### Android Studio, SDK and Tools

The first thing you want to do when starting with Android development is to get the SDK and probably also the Android Studio IDE.
While I really like a proper system integration of tools in Linux, unfortunately there really is none
and I ended up going the ugly but simple and effective way of just [downloading the Android Studio as a zip file](https://developer.android.com/studio/).
That will quickly give you a working development environment while also packing some stuff into your home folder
â€¦and not even as hidden files. But maybe, you can configure that somewhere.

Starting the Android Studio and creating a new test project, I was greeted by the (to me) familiar sight of Intellij IDEA
since Google dropped the old Eclipse based Android Studio I had been using before. I don't mind.
What I thought was a bit funny was that IDEA was already recommending changes in the newly created project.
Maybe Google should update their templates:

In any case, I was ready for development.


### Connecting Devices

While I could have used the Android emulator for testing,
I wanted to connect my smartphone instead.
I though this would come handy in particular when I started working on some bug-fixes for Apps I use
since there I would have real data.

This needed a bit of configuration.
First, I had to choose between the android-tools packaged in Fedora and the ones I got along with the Android Studio and SDK.
I opted for the latter since they are newer and I now had them anyway.
I also needed to set-up some udev rules to properly set permissions.
Doing that, a stupid typo in the rules file name cost me around an hour. Avoid that.
For the whole process, I found a surprisingly good and short guide in the [Fedora Forums](https://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?298965)
which helped me to get to where I wanted.

Additionally to this, I had to configure my device.
This was a matter of tapping the Build Number entry in the phone's settings seven times,
after which I was declared a developer and the Developer settings appeared in which I could enable USB debugging.

### The First App (Again)

Playing a little bit with my test App and slightly extending it  by adding a new dialog,
I found that things still worked essentially the same as four years ago
and 20min later I had my new App running on my device:

I've also played a bit with my old [andCA](https://github.com/lkiesow/andCA) App which I was still able to install and launch.
I wouldn't say that it's still running though.
It looked really ugly and parts where crashing.


### Fixing Simple-Calendar

Due to my struggle with udev, I had lost some time and I decided to go only for one final App fix
which I decided should be [Simple-Calendar](https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-Calendar).
It's an App I really like but which has a flaw in its iCalendar generation for CalDAV clients
which causes it to generate invalid single day, all-day events.

Poking around in its Kodlin source code, a language I hadn't worked with before (yay, more new stuff!),
I finally managed to locate the problem and was able to produce a [very simple bug fix](https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-Calendar/pull/684)
for the problem.

*That concludes day 1.*


Kubernetes: Automatic Deployment at Scale
=========================================

*Research topic for October 30, 2018*

Today, Kubernetes is the de-facto standard when it comes to container orchestration and deployment.
I've read about it, talked to people about it, I know what it is doing butâ€¦
I've never actually used it.
That's to be changed today!


Getting Started
---------------

Looking around for resources, I ended up with the interactive
[Kubernetes Basics Tutorial](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/)
of [kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io).
Usually, I dislike long tutorials because I'm more a hands-on person
but this tutorial does let you play with a real Kubernetes environment
where you can ignore the instructions at any time to shortly try something else.

I also found the online shell (including auto-completion) used for the tutorial a pleasant surprise.
In short: I really recommend this tutorial to get started.


### Non-Scaling Kubernetes

Looking at Kubernetes, one of the first things you learn is that Kubernetes is really meant for larger systems, not for your one server at home:

> A Kubernetes cluster that handles production traffic should have a minimum of three nodes.

In a way, this makes sense because that will give you a failover e.g. if a node goes down or you have to run maintenance on it.
It's also not that hard if you run in an agile, server-less environment by e.g. relying on one of the big cloud providers.
Nevertheless, that does makes it hard to use in a small scale on your home server.

Sure, there are a few solutions like kubeadm for [creating a single master cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/create-cluster-kubeadm/)
but options like these do not seem to be [stable](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/create-cluster-kubeadm/#kubeadm-maturity) right now
and in most cases (e.g. [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/)) are actually only meant for testing.

For my upcoming server update, I'll hence likely not rely on Kubernetes.
Nevertheless I will still use containers.
I will also continue to look into this since even if you loose some of the high-availability features,
a small scale Kubernetes will still provide you with a homogeneous deployment option for all types of setups.


### Kubernetes @Work

Looking at what I am usually doing at work and assessing the possibilities Kubernetes would provide,
I think we would benefit quite a bit from using it.
The main problem would likely be to convince University data-centers I usually work with
to run a Kubernetes cluster.
Weird as it may sound, I found them having a tendency to be extremely conservative
and reluctant to introduce new technologies
despite them being research institutions.

Right now we are managing quite a number of virtual machines to run applications.
A lot of these are really small applications (e.g. consider [docs.opencast.org](https://docs.opencast.org)
which is barely more than a web-server with static content)
and it really does not matter where they run.
But right now, you always have to make a concious decision to either provision a new virtual machine for such a service
or to bundle it with another service on a single machine.

Not having to care about this would be great and would remove quite a bit of daily work while making hardware provisioning, etc. much easier.
After all, we can easily replace a whole Node
and Kubernetes will take care of the services running somewhere.


### More Kubernetes

Screw the schedule ðŸ˜¼
I've decided to look into this a bit further.
Certainly as part of the cloud provider test,
but I will also try another local deployment.
