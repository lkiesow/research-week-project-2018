Research Week: The Idea
=======================

Working in IT, you see a lot of interesting topics which you like to take a closer look at.
New projects and technologies are developed every day.
Old technologies have evolved over time.

As a student I always liked to play with these technologies.
Now, with my full time job it's actually not that easy anymore.
I'll try to keep myself updated but unfortunately
I cannot just spend a day ignoring my job,
playing with some new and fancy project.
The problem of timeâ€¦

That's why I decided to take a week off and dedicate this time to just that:
Trying new stuff, looking on how things have evolved over the last years
and finally, reporting my findings on this project blog.

Let's get started.
